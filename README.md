guilds.js is a Node.js library for using the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

## Repository Structure

This monorepo houses both the documentation site and the npm library for guilds.js.

- **`docs/`**: This is where you'll find the source code and pages for the [documentation site](https://guilds.js.org). It's powered by Astro Starlight and is written in Markdown and MDX. Everything under `src/content/docs/api/` is automatically generated documentation for the guilds.js library.

- **`package/`**: This is where the main source code of the guilds.js library. It's written in TypeScript and is organized under the `src/` directory, including types, classes, utilities, functions, variables, and more. You can view it on npm [here](https://npmjs.com/package/guilds.js).
